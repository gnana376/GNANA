    <h1>The Enchanted Forest's Secret</h1> <!-- Heading tag -->

    <p><small>Deep in the heart of an ancient, mist-shrouded forest,</small></p> <!-- Small tag -->

    <p>
        here lived a <b>young herbalist named Lila.</b>She was known throughout the nearby villages for her extraordinary ability to<i>heal even the most stubborn of ailments</i>ever.  <!-- Bold and Italic tags -->
    </p>

    <p>
        One crisp autumn morning, as Lila was gathering herbs, <u> she stumbled upon a hidden glade she had never seen before.</u>. <!-- Underline tag -->
    </p>

    <hr> <!-- Horizontal rule tag -->

    <p>
        In the center stood an enormous, gnarled oak tree,  <br>its branches reaching towards the sky like grasping fingers. <!-- Break tag -->
    </p>

    <q>
        Intrigued,<del> Lila approached the tree. </del> she noticed something peculiar - "a tiny door, no taller than her hand, set into the trunk". Curiosity overcame caution, and she gently pushed it open. <!-- Delete and qoutation tags -->
    </q>

    <p>
        To her amazement,<abbr title="the tree was hollow,">treeHlw</abbr>, and inside was a spiral staircase leading down into darkness. Taking a deep breath, Lila began to descend.<!-- Abbreviation tag -->
    </p>

    <pre>
        The air was thick with magic, 
        and all around her grew plants she had never seen before
        - plants with leaves that shimmered 
        like starlight and flowers 
        that hummed soft melodies.
    </pre> <!-- Preformatted tag -->

    <p>
        <b>Welcome, young healer.</b>  You have found the heart of the forest's magic.<s>"Use it wisely."</s> <b>Lila realized she had stumbled upon the source of her healing abilities - </b>and so much more. With this newfound knowledge, she knew her life would never be the same.<!-- Strike and Bold tags -->
    </p>

    <p>
        From that day forward,<sup>Lila became not just a healer, </sup> but <sub> a guardian of the forest's secrets. </sub> She used her expanded powers to protect both the natural world and the people she cared for, always remembering the responsibility that came with such a gift.<!-- Superscript and Subscript tags -->
    </p>

    <p>
        And so, the legend of Lila, the Forest Witch, began - a tale of wisdom, magic, and the deep connection between <i>humanity</i> and <b>nature</b> everywhere.
